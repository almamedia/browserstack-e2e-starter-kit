Contributing
============

Contributions are more than welcome, that being the feature scope of this project is quite small and as it's more of a starting point than a fully-fledge Node module feel free to fork this repo and make a customized version to match your needs.

Basically what we're mostly after are bug reports, bug fixes and improvements to existing features. So feel free to open up a [new issue](https://github.com/almamedia/browserstack-e2e-starter-kit/issues/new) or better yet send a pull request.


For project owners with push rights
-----------------------------------

For trivial changes (such as typo fixes, small syntax fixes or documentation changes) you can push the changes directly to master.

For non-trivial and/or more extensive changes should be sent as pull request.
